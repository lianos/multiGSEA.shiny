\title{A ReactiveGeneSetDb for use in the shiiny world.}
\usage{
reactiveGeneSetDb(
  input,
  output,
  session,
  gdb,
  min.gs.size = 2L,
  max.gs.size = Inf,
  default_collections = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdb}{A static or reactive GeneSetDb object}

\item{min.gs.size, max.gs.size}{the default minimum and maximum geneset size
set in the UI when `gdb` is first loaded or changes (when reactive)}
}
\description{
This can be instantiated from a "static" or "reactive" GeneSetDb object.
It allows users to customize which genesets are active by:
}
\details{
1. Filtering out entire collections; and
2. Filtering genesets based on min and max (gene) size.

This should be in mutliGSEA.shiny, but is developed here for now to make
it easier to develop within the FacieAnalysis shiny world.
