Copied from FacileViz, but we don't want to depend on that.
}
\details{
For some reason, sometimes a selectInput returns `NULL` and other times
it returns `""`, so I'm just making this utility function to deal with that

NOTE: This is really a function that is used by shiny modules, but instead
of having every shiny function check if something is "unselected" and setting
it to NULL, we move that functionality in here so that internal vizualization
functions can do that jusst once
}
